# 🏦 Simple Bank Account (useReducer Practice)

A small React mini-project built to practice **useReducer** by modeling basic bank account operations.

## 🚀 Features

This project simulates a simple bank account with the following actions:

- **🟢 openAccount** — Activates the account with a minimum opening deposit of **500**  
- **➕ deposit** — Adds money to the balance  
- **➖ withdraw** — Removes money from the balance  
- **💳 requestLoan** — Lets the user request a loan *only if there is no existing loan*  
- **💸 payLoan** — Pays back the active loan  
- **🔴 closeAccount** — Closes the account (only possible when balance and loan are both zero)

All actions (except opening the account) only work when the account is **active**.
